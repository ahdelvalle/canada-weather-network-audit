## 🔬 Methodology

### Audit Criteria

Each station was evaluated on three dimensions:

1. **Data Availability** (33.3%)
   - Recent observations within last 3 hours
   - API accessibility and response times
   - Network connectivity

2. **Data Completeness** (33.3%)
   - Presence of essential parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure)
   - Missing data rates
   - Observation frequency

3. **Data Quality** (33.3%)
   - Physical plausibility checks
   - Statistical outlier detection
   - Consistency validation

### Quality Score Classification

- **🟢 Operational**: Quality Score ≥ 70%
- **🟡 Degraded**: Quality Score 40-69%
- **🔴 Failed**: Quality Score < 40%
